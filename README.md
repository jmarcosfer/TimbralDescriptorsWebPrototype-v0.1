# freesound feature extension prototype

Adding timbral descriptor sliders to filter search results.

Since it intends to be an extension to [Freesound](https://freesound.org), some bits of code are copied from [their open codebase over at GitHub](https://github.com/MTG/freesound) and by poking around with the dev tools in chrome.
